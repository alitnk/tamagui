## API

### &lt;Toast /&gt;

Contains the Title, Description, Action and Close component. Extends [Stack](/docs/components/stack#api) and adds:

      type: 'boolean',
      required: false,

### &lt;Title /&gt;

### &lt;ToastProvider /&gt;

Your toasts should be wrapped within a `ToastProvider`. This is usually done at the root of your application.

<PropsTable
  data={[
    {
      name: 'label',
      required: false,
      type: 'string',
      description: `An author-localized label for each toast. Used to help screen reader users associate the interruption with a toast.`,
      default: 'Notification',
    },
    {
      name: 'duration',
      required: false,
      type: 'number',
      description: `Time in milliseconds that each toast should remain visible for. This could be overwritten at the toast level as well.`,
      default: 5000,
    },
    {
      name: 'swipeDirection',
      required: false,
      type: 'SwipeDirection',
      description: `Direction of pointer swipe that should close the toast.`,
      default: 'right',
    },
    {
      name: 'swipeThreshold',
      required: false,
      type: 'number',
      description: `Distance in pixels that the swipe must pass before a close is triggered.`,
      default: 50,
    },
    {
      name: 'id',
      required: false,
      type: 'string',
      default: 'A unique generated ID',
    },
  ]}
/>

### &lt;Viewport /&gt;

The portal for toasts to be directed to. Beyond [Stack Props](/docs/components/stacks/1.0.0), adds:

<PropsTable
  data={[
    { 
      name: "hotkey",
       type: 'string[]', 
       default: "['F8']", 
       required: false, 
       description: `The keys to use as the keyboard shortcut that will move focus to the toast viewport.` 
    },
    { 
      name: "label",
       type: 'string', 
       default: 'Notifications ({hotkey})', 
       required: false, 
       description: `An author-localized label for the toast viewport to provide context for screen reader users when navigating page landmarks. The available \`{hotkey}\` placeholder will be replaced for you.` 
    },
    { 
      name: "name",
       type: 'string', 
       required: false, 
       description: `Used to reference the viewport if you want to have multiple viewports in the same provider.` 
  }
  ]}
/>
